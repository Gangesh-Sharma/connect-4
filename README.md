This repository presents a comprehensive implementation of the classic game Connect 4, enriched by the integration of the sophisticated Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. This intelligent algorithm strategically evaluates prospective moves by simulating random games and systematically constructs a game tree based on the ensuing outcomes. Here's an in-depth explanation of how it functions: The MCTS algorithm takes the current state of the Connect 4 game and, for each conceivable move, carries out game simulations until a terminal state (indicating the end of the game) is attained. It meticulously constructs the game tree, meticulously storing statistics regarding the desirability of each position at every node, informed by the outcomes of these simulations.

In the process of transitioning from the root of the tree to a specific node, the algorithm adeptly employs the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) approach, which effectively balances the exploration of uncharted positions while simultaneously favoring moves that have demonstrated success in previous simulations. Notable files within this repository include mcts.py, serving as the home to the MCTS algorithm implementation, and play.py, the portal to execute the program on the paper games website. Furthermore, the presence of grid.png is essential, as it enables OpenCV to accurately pinpoint the locations of Connect 4 pieces on the website. The project relies on several vital dependencies, including the keyboard library for efficient keyboard event management, pyautogui for streamlined GUI automation, mouse for meticulous mouse event handling, time for performing various time-related operations, and webbrowser, which facilitates a high-level interface for rendering web-based documents, possibly opening a web browser to interact with Connect 4 games.

In addition to these dependencies, the repository incorporates custom modules or classes such as connect4 and mcts, meticulously designed to encompass the Connect 4 game logic and the MCTS algorithm, respectively. These components collectively ensure a robust and feature-rich implementation of Connect 4, complete with an intelligent game-playing agent powered by the MCTS algorithm.
